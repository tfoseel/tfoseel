## üíª About Me

Hello! I am Lee Seungwoo. I am a novice programmer, studying at School of Computing at KAIST since 2019.   
Recently I started writing posts on velog and upload some code snippets on Github.   
I'm interested in finding out problems in daily life or making contents that makes people feel better.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Study

<img src="http://mazandi.herokuapp.com/api?handle=leesoft&theme=warm"/>

* Currently I study algorithms and solving some problems in C++ on Baekjoon Online Judge, to improve an ability to implement what I think quickly and accurately. 
Solving some problems, I'm trying to modularize some code snippets for frequently used algorithms or programming strategies(i.e. graph search, dynamic programming) 
in [algorithm-problem-solving](https://github.com/tfoseel/algorithm-problem-solving) repository. 
* Also, I am reading a book about machine learning & deep learning basics using Tensorflow and Keras.
* I usually use these languages : Python, C++.
* I experienced these languages : Python, MATLAB, Java, F#, R, Scala, C, C++.
* I experienced these tools/frameworks : HTML/CSS/JS, jQuery, Node.js, Express, React, Redux, Android Studio, Firebase.
