## 💻 About Me

Hello! I’m **Lee Seungwoo**, a **Computer Science graduate from KAIST** and a **product engineer at [Yolda Company](https://www.yolda.kr/)** — which provides homecare O2O services such as arrangements, or smart housework.

I believe that **technology, at its best, feels like a love letter** — written for one, yet capable of touching countless hearts.  
That philosophy guides my work, from research in **quantum AI** to **apps that heal human emotion**.

My GitHub ID **tfoseel** is simply **leesoft** reversed — a reminder to build things that reflect who I am, turned inside out.

## ✏️ Study & Research

[![Solved.ac Profile](http://mazassumnida.wtf/api/v2/generate_badge?boj=leesoft)](https://solved.ac/leesoft/)

🧠 **Fields I care deeply about:**
- **Human-centered AI** — designing systems that understand emotion and intention  
- **Quantum Computing** — exploring how abstract computation reveals structure in reality  
- **Systems & Infrastructure** — making ideas scale from a single spark to something real

📰 **Publications**
- *Resource-efficient Algorithm for Estimating the Trace of Quantum State Powers*, **Quantum**, vol. 9, 1832 (2025)  
- *Disentangling Quantum Neural Networks for Unified Estimation of Quantum Entropies and Distance Measures*, **Physical Review A**, vol. 110, 062418 (2024)

## 💡 Values & Philosophy

I’m drawn to technologies that *feel personal*.  
I enjoy creating systems that:
- **connect emotion with logic**,  
- **turn inefficiency into elegance**, and  
- **help one person, yet resonate with many**.

Sometimes that’s an AI model;  
sometimes, it’s just a line of code that makes someone smile. 🌷

## 🎈 Hobbies

- 🎹 Playing piano to reset my mind  
- 🏓 Table tennis for balance and focus  
- ✍️ Writing design notes that explore emotion and technology
