## üíª About Me

Hello! I am Lee Seungwoo. I am a novice programmer, studying at School of Computing at KAIST since 2019.
I'm interested in finding out problems in daily life or making contents that makes people feel better.   
My Github ID 'tfoseel' is a reversed text of 'leesoft', which is a nickname I frequently use.
You can take a look of my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_Tb5F5hBEN0N_hHZoS80idRCtrjY_URm/view?usp=sharing) here.
