## 💻 About Me

Hello! I’m **Lee Seungwoo**, a **Computer Science graduate from KAIST** and a **Product Engineer at [Yolda Company](https://www.yolda.kr/)** — building what I call a *Space OS*.

At Yolda, I design systems that help spaces remember their own context.  
Not just where things are — but *why they are there*, and how people live within them.

I work across the entire product spectrum:
- product planning and user research (including on-site interviews and real home cleaning),
- AI system design (LLM, RAG pipelines, structured reasoning),
- voice interfaces,
- backend architecture and UX logic.

My goal is to turn physical space into something that can be structured, understood, and gently assisted by technology.

I believe that **technology, at its best, feels like a love letter** — written for one, yet capable of touching countless hearts.  
That philosophy guides my work, from quantum AI research to infrastructure that supports everyday human life.

My GitHub ID **tfoseel** is simply **leesoft** reversed — a reminder to build things that reflect who I am, turned inside out.

## ✏️ Study & Research

[![Solved.ac Profile](http://mazassumnida.wtf/api/v2/generate_badge?boj=leesoft)](https://solved.ac/leesoft/)

🧠 **Fields I care deeply about:**
- **Human-centered AI** — designing systems that understand emotion and intention  
- **Quantum Computing** — exploring how abstract computation reveals structure in reality  
- **Systems & Infrastructure** — making ideas scale from a single spark to something real

📰 **Publications**
- *Resource-efficient Algorithm for Estimating the Trace of Quantum State Powers*, **Quantum**, vol. 9, 1832 (2025)  
- *Disentangling Quantum Neural Networks for Unified Estimation of Quantum Entropies and Distance Measures*, **Physical Review A**, vol. 110, 062418 (2024)

## 💡 Values & Philosophy

I’m drawn to technologies that *feel personal*.  
I enjoy creating systems that:
- **connect emotion with logic**,  
- **turn inefficiency into elegance**, and  
- **help one person, yet resonate with many**.

Sometimes that’s an AI model;  
sometimes, it’s just a line of code that makes someone smile. 🌷
